# L1BossBridge Smart Contract Audit Report

## Overview

This repository contains the security audit report for the `L1BossBridge` smart contract. The contract facilitates token bridging between Layer 1 (L1) and Layer 2 (L2) by locking ERC-20 tokens in an `L1Vault` and emitting deposit events for off-chain processing. Withdrawals require ECDSA signature verification to prevent unauthorized access.

## Audit Scope

- **Contract Audited:** `L1BossBridge`
- **Blockchain Platform:** Ethereum (Solidity 0.8.20)
- **External Dependencies:** OpenZeppelin Contracts (Ownable, ReentrancyGuard, SafeERC20, ECDSA, etc.)

## Audit Objectives

The primary objectives of this audit are:

- Ensure the contract functions as intended without vulnerabilities.
- Identify potential security risks, including reentrancy, unauthorized access, and replay attacks.
- Review the correctness and efficiency of signature verification and deposit/withdrawal mechanisms.

## Key Findings

_(Detailed findings and recommendations will be included in the full report.)_
